# GCM Master Class Revamp

GCM Master Class website redesign.

I am not a good designer but I did my best to add some features like navbar to improve user experience which is very important and one thing that should be prioritized. I also changed theme color for the site to glow and manage some fonts for the texts to become more readable.

Please enjoy!
